# Account

## Email confirmation recovery

Password accounts must confirm their email before signing in. When a user submits the correct
password for an unconfirmed account, the API keeps an existing valid confirmation link or issues
and emails a replacement when that link has expired. The sign-in form warns the user which action
was taken.

Forgot-password requests for unconfirmed accounts do not create password-reset tokens. They follow
the same confirmation-link recovery behavior and show a warning that email confirmation is required
before a password can be reset.

Confirmation and password-reset emails render the named `server/templates/account-action.html`
file. The mailer parses `heading`, `message`, `action`, `url`, and `footer` placeholders and
HTML-escapes every substituted value. Additional email layouts can use another named `.html` file
in the same directory; unknown placeholders or unavailable templates stop delivery.

## Password changes

Authenticated users can change their password from the account page by providing their current
password and a matching new password of 8–128 characters. The new password must differ from the
current password.

Changing a password rotates the account session key, revokes existing sessions and pending account
action tokens, and issues a replacement session token to the device that submitted the change.
